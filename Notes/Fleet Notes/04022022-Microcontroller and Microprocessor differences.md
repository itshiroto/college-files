- Microprocessor only contains the CPU, other components need to be connected externally. Microcontroller has a CPU, along with other components like internal memory and I/O components.
- Because it contains only the processor, microprocessor circuit would becomes large. Hence it can't be use it in compact systems.
- Also, more external components can cause the entire system power consumption to increase, therefore it's not suitable to used with devices running on battery.
- Cost of the entire system in microprocessor increases because of the circuit size.
- Microcontroller often has fixed amount of function in it's software and generally specific to the application.
- Microcontroller usually does not provide an interface for human. Because microcontroller is programmed for a specific task, embedded within the devices, and executes as and when required.
- Microprocessor is generally used on personal computers because of it's modularity and speed. Meanwhile Microcontroller is usually used with application-specific machines like washing machines, air conditioners, multimedia system in cars, etc.
