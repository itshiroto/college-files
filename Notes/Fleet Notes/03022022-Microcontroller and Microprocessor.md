## Microprocessor
Microprocessor (also known as the [[03022022-CPU | processor]]) is a part of computer that controls the operation of the computer and performs its data processing functions. Put it simply, it's like the brain for computer. 

Microprocessor chips includes registers, an ALU, and some control unit or instruction processing logic. And as the transistor density increased, the chips become smaller and more complex. Not only that, later microprocessor chips also includes memory and more processors, to increase its efficiency and speed.

## Microcontroller
Microcontroller is a single chip that controls the function of embedded systems in many machines. It's basically a computer on a chip, because it has a microprocessor, RAM (volatile memory), ROM (non-volatile memory), a clock, and an I/O control unit. The microprocessor used in microcontroller has much lower silicon area than regular microprocessor and thus slower but a lot more efficient than its counterparts.
