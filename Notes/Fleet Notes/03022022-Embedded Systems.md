## Definition
An Embedded Systems is a microprocessor-based system and is part of a larger systems, device, or machine. It is built to control and run a function or range of functions, but not designed to be programmed or modified by the end user.

## Difference with regular PC
What makes it different with regular computer is that embedded systems has **fixed** amount of functions that it can do, and end user cannot add and/or replacing the software of this systems to change the functionality. 

For example, a systems inside an air conditioner contains a function for controlling the air flow of the rotors, receiving IR data from the remote control, and managing power to distribute over the rotors, fans, etc. But you cannot add a custom software to it, or even write an entire essay on the systems. Because the designer only design the air conditioner to do those specific tasks.
