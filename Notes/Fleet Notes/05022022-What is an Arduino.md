Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino has family of boards, one of the popular one is *Arduino Uno* which is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P chip. It is used by tinkerers, hobbyists, and makers to design and build devices and/or machines that interact with the real world. Put it simply, Arduino board are used as a tool for controlling electronics/peripherals by reading inputs and turning it into outputs.

Usually, an Arduino Board contains few components that are really helpful to create a device from scratch. One of the most important components is a bunch of pins that are used to connect with various components you might want to use with the Arduino. These pins (along with the serial connector) is the main feature of Arduino, because most of the time you will use these components to communicate with other peripherals, and with the developer. But I/O pins are useless if there's nothing to control them. That's why microcontroller in Arduino comes in handy. Because it handles all the instructions and data receives from the peripherals, and converting them into appropriate output. 

With these components, you can make a lot of creative machines and devices. For example, you can make a lamp controller for your bedroom so whether it's dusk or dawn, the lights in your room will be automatically toggled. Another one, you can convert a Drum-style game controller from Guitar Hero into an [actual MIDI Drum kit](https://archive.org/details/evan-kale-youtube-archive/Arduino+Drum+MIDI+_+Rock+Band+Guitar+Hero+Mod-vi-w_WqJjzQ.mkv) that you can use to play music.

As stated before, Arduino is very popular among IT hobbyists, robot makers, and tinkerers. Because Arduino is affordable, easy to learn, and very compact compared to regular boards. You can get an Arduino board with price starting from Rp300.000. Alongside that, there's so many resources that you can use to learn Arduino from scratch. From books to YouTube videos, there are endless source of learning materials for an Arduino.
