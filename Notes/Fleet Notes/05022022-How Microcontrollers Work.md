There are 3 main elements of a [[03022022-Microcontroller and Microprocessor | microcontroller]]; [[03022022-CPU]], Memory, and I/O peripherals. The microcontroller then embedded inside of a system to control a singular function in a device. Then, the microcontroller receives data from its I/O peripherals, and then interpreting the data using its central processor.

Those interpreted data then stored in the data memory, where the processor can accesses it. Then the processor uses the instructions stored in the memory to decipher and apply the incoming data. The microcontroller then uses its I/O peripherals to output the data, or communicate and enact the appropriate action.
